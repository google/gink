/**
    Muid: Generally corresponds to the object-id for an object in the
    database, intended to be globally unique.

    * The timestamp and medallion may be omitted (=0) in muids found inside
      rows when they point to another row in the same commit.

    * The medallion may be omitted (=0) for a muid that points to a row
      from the same stream.

    * The offset value of 0 (omitted) referrs to the commit.

    The limits specified below allow a Muid to be packed into a canonical
    16 byte representation: effectively a 128-bit integer that
    corresponds to (timestamp << 72) + (medallion << 20) + offset,
    encoded big-endian.
